- **Target ROAS**: 400% (4.0)
- **Maximum CPA**: $50

These assumptions can be adjusted in the configuration for more accurate projections.

## Integration with Main Workflow

The Report Generator is integrated into the main automation workflow as Step 6:

```python
# Step 6: Comprehensive Report Generation
comprehensive_report = report_generator.generate_comprehensive_report(
    campaign=campaign,
    keywords=keywords,
    brand_analysis=brand_analysis,
    pmax_campaigns=pmax_campaigns
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from modules.report_generator import ReportGenerator

# Initialize with configuration
report_generator = ReportGenerator(config)

# Generate comprehensive report
report = report_generator.generate_comprehensive_report(
    campaign=campaign_data,
    keywords=keyword_data,
    brand_analysis=business_analysis,
    pmax_campaigns=pmax_data
)
```

### Custom Performance Assumptions

```python
# Modify performance assumptions
report_generator.performance_assumptions = {
    'avg_ctr': 0.025,  # 2.5% CTR
    'avg_conversion_rate': 0.03,  # 3% conversion rate
    'avg_order_value': 150.0,  # $150 average order
    'target_roas': 5.0,  # 500% ROAS target
    'max_cpa': 40.0,  # $40 maximum CPA
}
```
